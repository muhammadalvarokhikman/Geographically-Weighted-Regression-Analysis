# Geographically Weighted Regression Analysis of House Prices in Jabodetabek

The Jabodetabek region (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi) is one of the most densely populated and economically significant metropolitan areas in Indonesia. The housing market in this region exhibits considerable variation due to diverse urban development patterns, accessibility to infrastructure, socio-economic factors, and geographic disparities.

To better understand the spatial dynamics of housing prices, this analysis applies a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) approach. Unlike traditional linear regression models that assume global homogeneity in relationships, GWR allows the coefficients to vary spatially—capturing local heterogeneity in how factors like the number of bedrooms, land area, building size, and number of floors influence housing prices.

By transforming house prices into logarithmic values, we improve model stability and meet the assumptions required for robust regression analysis. The GWR model demonstrates significantly improved performance compared to ordinary least squares (OLS), achieving a high adjusted R² of 0.842. This reveals that spatial variation plays a key role in shaping housing price determinants across different neighborhoods in Jabodetabek.

This study provides valuable insights for urban planners, developers, and policymakers seeking to understand local market conditions and develop more targeted housing policies based on spatial evidence.
